Picarro G2307 Formaldehyde Measurements
12 Oct 2021 - 12 Dec. 2022

Variables:
time_utc, Time of measurement in UTC timezone
hcho_ppb, Formaldehyde measurement reported by Picarro G2307. Averaged to 1 min from 1 Hz native time resolution. Calibrated using formaldehyde standard from Apel-Riemer on 8 Oct 2021 and Airgas standard on 13 Sep. 2022.

PLATFORM: Measured 5 m above ground, 8 m inlet line length (line is PTFE with 0.25 in OD), indoor portion of line heated to 115 deg F / 46 deg C, flow rate of 444.38 ccm with std of 0.20 ccm. From 28 July - 13 Sep. 2022, inlet line teed with Aeris Pico. Full setup description can be found in in Mouat et al. (2023) (in preparation).
LOCATION: Environmental Protection Divison South Dekalb site: 2300-C Wildcat Road, Decatur GA 30034, Lat: 33.6878, Lon: -84.2905
INSTRUMENT INFO: Picarro G2307 Gas Concentration Analyzer; https://www.picarro.com/products/g2307_gas_concentration_analyzer
DATA INFO: All data in parts per billion (ppb), averaged to 1 min. Processed using MATLAB R2021a.
UNCERTAINTY: Manufacturer reported measurement uncertainty for Picarro G2307 is +/- 10 %. Initial calibration (8 Oct. 2021) with Apel-Riemer standard has uncertainty of +/- 5 %, resulting measurement uncertainty is +/- 11 %. Second calibration (13 Sep 2022) conducted with Airgas standard with an uncertainty of +/- 10 %, resulting in 14 % uncertainty. Calibration slopes agree within 2.5 %. Instrument precision calculated using Allen-Werle curve and scrubbed air measurments. Data is reported here at 1 min time resolution with precision of 200 ppt. At 5 min averaging, precision is 70 ppt. At 20 min, precision is 55 ppt.

STIPULATIONS ON USE: Use of these data requires prior approval from the PI.
OTHER_COMMENTS: Missing periods result from spikes/drops in pressure or temperature, setup issues (e.g. H2O in inlet), exhaustion of HCHO scrubber used to determine instrument baseline, or other possible external influences tampering with data.
REVISION: R0
R0: Formaldehyde concentration time series measured at the Environmental Protection Division's South Dekalb site starting on 12 Oct. 2021. Initial version, processed on 12-12-2022 by A. P. Mouat (amouat3@gatech.edu)
